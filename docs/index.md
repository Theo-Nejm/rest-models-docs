### 🛠 How does it works?

+ Rest Models library is recommended to use just with REST APIs and we strongly discourage using it on different types of API.

+ To learn more about REST APIs, [follow this link.](https://restfulapi.net/)

+ Rest Models works using Models and Collections to make easier the process of managing data on frontend applications.

+ Models basically are classes with some util methods that get your work easier on working with external rest api data.
